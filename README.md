# mod-outdoor-scaling

Outdoor-only creature HP and Damage scaling for AzerothCore, split by expansion continents (Vanilla, BC, WotLK). You can set continent defaults, override specific zones or creatures, and inspect live values with `.os mapstat` and `.os creaturestat`. Instances, battlegrounds, arenas, and pets/guardians are untouched so Autobalance can continue handling indoor content.
